    **4.** A **deformation retraction in the weak sense** of a space :math:`X` to a subspace :math:`A` is a 
    homotopy :math:`f_t : X\rightarrow X` such that :math:`f_0 = \mathbb{1}, \, f_1(X) \subset A`, and :math:`f_t(A) \subset A` for all :math:`t`. Show 
    that if :math:`X` deformation retracts to :math:`A` in this weak sense, then the inclusion :math:`A \hookrightarrow X` is 
    a homotopy equivalence.

    **6.** (a) Let :math:`X` be the subspace of :math:`\mathbb{R}^2` consisting of the horizontal segment 
    :math:`[0,1] \times \{0\}` together with all the vertical segments :math:`\{r\} \times [0,1-r]` for

    **7.** Fill in the details in the following construction from 
    [Edwards 1999] of a compact space :math:`Y \subset \mathbb{R}^3` with the 
    same properties as the space :math:`Y` in :ref:`Exercise 6 <ex-0-0-06>`, that is, :math:`Y`
    is contractible but does not deformation retract to any 
    point. To begin, let :math:`X` be the union of an infinite sequence
    of cones on the Cantor set arranged end-to-end, 
    as in the figure. Next, form the one-point compactification
    of :math:`X \times \mathbb{R}`. This embeds in :math:`\mathbb{R}^3` as a closed disk with curved 'fins' attached along
    circular arcs, and with the one-point compactification of :math:`X` as a cross-sectional slice. 
    The desired space :math:`Y` is then obtained from this subspace of :math:`\mathbb{R}^3` by wrapping one more 
    cone on the Cantor set around the boundary of the disk.

    **10.** Show that a space :math:`X` is contractible iff every map :math:`f:X \rightarrow Y`, for arbitrary :math:`Y`, is 
    nullhomotopic. Similarly, show :math:`X` is contractible iff every map :math:`f: Y \rightarrow X` is nullhomotopic.

    **11.** Show that :math:`f:X \rightarrow Y` is a homotopy equivalence if there exist maps :math:`g,h:Y \rightarrow X`
    such that :math:`fg \simeq \mathcal{1}` and :math:`hf \simeq \mathbb{1}`. More generally, show that :math:`f` is a homotopy equivalence 
    if :math:`fg` and :math:`hf` are homotopy equivalences.

    **12.** Show that a homotopy equivalence :math:`f:X\rightarrow Y` induces a bijection between the set 
    of path-components of :math:`X` and the set of path-components of :math:`Y`, and that :math:`f` restricts to 
    a homotopy equivalence from each path-component of :math:`X` to the corresponding path 
    component of :math:`Y`. Prove also the corresponding statements with components instead 
    of path-components. Deduce that if the components of a space :math:`X` coincide with its 
    path-components, then the same holds for any space :math:`Y` homotopy equivalent to :math:`X`.

    **13.** Show that any two deformation retractions :math:`r^0_t` and :math:`r^1_t` of a space :math:`X` onto a 
    subspace :math:`A` can be joined by a continuous family of deformation retractions :math:`r^s_t`,
    :math:`0 \leq s \leq 1`, of :math:`X` onto :math:`A`, where continuity means that the map :math:`X \times I \times I \rightarrow X` sending
    :math:`(x,s,t)` to :math:`r^s_t(x)` is continuous.

    spaces :math:`X * Y / (X *\{y_0\} \cup \{x_0\} *Y)` and :math:`S(X\wedge Y)/S(\{x_0\} \wedge \{y_0\})` are homeomorphic,

    **25.** If :math:`X` is a CW complex with components :math:`X_\alpha`, show that the suspension :math:`SX` is 
    homotopy equivalent to :math:`\bigvee_\alpha SX_\alpha` for some graph :math:`Y`. In the case that :math:`X` is a finite
    gprah, show that :math:`SX` is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of circles and :math:`2`-spheres.

    **26.** Use :ref:`Corollary 0.20 <Corollary 0.20>` to show that if :math:`(X,A)` has the homotopy extension property,
    then :math:`X \times I` deformation retracts to :math:`X \times \{0\} \cup A \times I`. Deduce from this that 
    :ref:`Proposition 0.18 <Proposition 0.18>` holds more generally for any pair :math:`(X_1, A)` satisfying the homotopy extension
    property.

    **27.** Given a pair :math:`(X,A)` and a homotopy equivalence :math:`f:A\rightarrow B`, show that the natural
    map :math:`X \rightarrow \sqcup_f X` is a homotopy equivalence if :math:`(X,A)` satisfies the homotopy extension 
    property. [Hint: Conisder :math:`X\cup M_f` and use the preceding problem.] An interesting 
    case is when :math:`f` is a quotient map, hence the map :math:`X \rightarrow B \sqcup_f X` is the quotient map
    identifying each set :math:`f^{-1}(b)` to a point. When :math:`B` is a point this gives another proof of 
    :ref:`Proposition 0.17 <Proposition 0.17>`.

    pair :math:`(X_0 \sqcup_f X_1, X_0)` obtained by attaching :math:`X_1` to a space :math:`X_0` via a map :math:`f:A \rightarrow X_0`.

    **29.** In case the CW complex :math:`X` is obtained from a subcomplex :math:`A` by attaching a single 
    cell :math:`e^n`, describe exactly what the extension of a homotopy :math:`f_t: A \rightarrow Y` to :math:`X` given by
    the proof of :ref:`Proposition 0.16 <proposition 0.16>` looks like. That is, for a point :math:`x \in e^n`, describe the path
    :math:`f_t(x)` for the extended :math:`f_t`.
