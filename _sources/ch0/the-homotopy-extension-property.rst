The Homotopy Extension Property
===============================

In this final section of the chapter we will actually prove a few things, including 
the two criteria for homotopy equivalence described above. The proofs depend upon 
a technical property that arises in many other contexts as well. Consider the following 
problem. Suppose one is given a map :math:`f_0:X \rightarrow Y`, and on a subspace :math:`A \subset X` one is also 
given a homotopy :math:`f_t:A \rightarrow Y` of :math:`f_0 \mid A` that one would like to extend to a homotopy 
:math:`f_t:X \rightarrow Y` of the given :math:`f_0`.
