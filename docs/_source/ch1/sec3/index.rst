1.3. Covering Spaces
=====================

|indent| We come now to the second main topic of this chapter, covering spaces. We
have laready encountered these briefly in our calculation of :math:`\pi_1(S^1)` which used the 
example of the projection :math:`\mathbb{R} \rightarrow S^1` of a helix onto a circle. As we will see, covering
spaces can be used to caluculate fundamental groups of other spaces as well. But the 
connection between the fundamental group and covering spaces runs much deeper
than this, and in many ways they can be regarded as two viewpoints toward the same
thing. Algebraic aspects of the fundamental group can often be translated into the
geometric language of covering spaces. This is exemplified in one of the main results
in this section, an exact correspondence between connected covering spaces of a given
space :math:`X` and subgroups of :math:`\pi_1(X)`. This is strikingly reminiscent of Galois theory, with 
its correspondence between field extensions and subgroups of the Galois group.

|indent| Let us recall the definition. A **covering space** of a space :math:`X` is a space :math:`\tilde{X}` together
with a map :math:`p: \tilde{X} \rightarrow X` satisfying the following condition: Each point :matH:`x \in X` has an 
open neighborhood :math:`U` in :math:`X` such that :math:`p^{-1}(U)` is a union of disjoint open sets in :Math:`\tilde{X}`,
each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto :math:`U` by :math:`p`. such a :math:`U` is called **evenly 
covered** and the disjoint open sets in :math:`\tilde{X}` that project homeomorphically to :math:`U` by :math:`p`
are called **sheets** of :math:`\tilde{X}` over :math:`U`. If :math:`U` is connected these sheets are the connected
components of :math:`p^{-1}(U)` so in this case they are uniquely determined by :math:`U`, but when
:math:`U` is not connected the decomposition of :math:`p^{-1}(U)` into sheets may not be unique. We
allow :math:`p^{-1}(U)` to be empty, the union of an empty collection of sheets over :math:`U`, so :math:`p`
need not be surjective. The number of sheets over :math:`U` is the cardinality of :math:`p^{-1}(x)` for 
:math:`x \in U`. As :math:`x` varies over :math:`X` this number is locally constant, so it is constant if :math:`X` is
connected.

|indent| An example related to the helix is the helicoid surface :math:`S \subset \mathbb{R}^3` consisting
of points of the form :math:`(s \cos 2\pi t, s \sin 2 \pi t, t)` for :math:`(s,t) \in (0, \infty) \times \mathbb{R}`. This projects
onto :math:`\mathbb{R}^2 - \{0\}` via the map :math:`(x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y)`, and this projection defines a voering 
space :math:`p:S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2 -\{0\}` since each point of :math:`\mathbb{R}^2 - \{0\}` is contained in an open disk :math:`U` in 
:math:`\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}` with :math:`p^{-1}(U)` consisting of countably many disjoint open disks in :math:`S` projecting
homeomorphically onto :math:`U`.

|indent| Another example is the map :math:`p:S^1 \rightarrow S^1,\, p(z)=z^n` where we
view :math:`z` as a complex number with :math:`|z| = 1` and :math:`n` is any positive
integer. The closest one can come to realizing this covering space
as a linear projection in :math:`3`-space analogous to the projection of the 
helix is to draw a circle wrapping around a cylinder :math:`n` times and 
intersecting itself in :math:`n-1` points that one has to imagine are not
really intersections. For an alternative picure without this defect,
embed :math:`S^1` in the boundary torus of a sloid torus :math:`S^1 \times D^2` so that it winds :math:`n` times
monotonically around the :math:`S^1` factor without self-intersections, then restrict the
projection :math:`S^1 \times D^2 \rightarrow S^1 \times \{0\}` to this embedded circle. The figure for :ref:`Example 1.29 <Example 1.29>` in the 
preceding section illustrates the case :math:`n=3`.

|indent| These :math:`n`-sheeted covering spaces :math:`S^1\rightarrow S^1` for :math:`n \geq 1` together with the infinite-sheeted
helix example exhaust all the connected coverings spaces of :math:`S^1`, as our general
theory will show. There are many other disconnected covering spaces of :math:`S^1`, such as
:math:`n` disjoint circles each mapped homeomorphically onto :math:`S^1`, but these disconnected
covering spaces are just disjoint unions of connected ones. We will usually restrict
our attention to connected covering spaces as these contain most of the interesting
features of covering spaces.

|indent| The covering spaces of :math:`S^1 \vee S^1` form a remarkably rich family illustrating most of
the general theory very concretely, so let us look at a few of these covering spaces to 
get an idea of what is going on. To abbreviate notation, set :Math:`X = S^1 \vee S^1`.

We view this
as a graph with one vertex and two edges. We label the edges
:math:`a` and :math:`b` and we choose orientations for :math:`a` and :math:`b`. Now let :math:`\tilde{X}`
be any other graph with four ends of edges at each vertex, as 
in :math:`X`, and suppose each edge of :math:`\tilde{X}` has been assigned a label :math:`a` or :math:`b` and an orientation
in such a way that the local picture near each vertex is the same as in :math:`X`, so there is an
:math:`a`-edge end oriented toward the vertex, and a :math:`b`-edge end oriented away from the 
vertex. To give a name to this structure, let us call :math:`\tilde{X}` a :math:`2`-*oriented* graph.

|indent| The table on the next page shows just a small sample of the infinite variety of possible examples.

|indent| Given a :math:`2`-oriented graph :math:`\tilde{X}` we can construct a map :math:`p:\tilde{X} \rightarrow X` sending all vertices
of :math:`\tilde{X}` to the vertex of :math:`X` and sending each edge of :math:`\tilde{X}` to the edge of :math:`X` with the same
label by a map that is a homeomorphism on the interior of the edge and preserves
orientation. It is clear that the covering space condition is satisfied for :math:`p`. Conversely,
every covering space of :math:`X` is a graph that inherits a :math:`2`-orientation from :math:`X`.

|indent| As the reader will discover by experimentation, it seems that every graph having 
four edge ends at each vertex can be :math:`2`-oriented. This can be proved for finite graphs as 
follows. A very clasical and easily shown fact is that every finite connected graph with
an even number of edge ends at each vertex has an Eulerian circuit, a loop traversing
each edge exactly once. If there are four edge ends at each vertex, then labeling the 
edges of an Eulerian circuit alternately :math:`a` and :math:`b` produces a labeling with two :math:`a`-edge
ends and two :math:`b`-edge ends at each vertex. The union of the :math:`a` edges is then a collection
of disjoint circles, as is the union of the :math:`b` edges. Choosing orientations for all these 
circles gives a :math:`2`-orientation. It is a theorem in graph theory that infinite graphs with
four edge ends at each vertex can also be :math:`2`-oriented; see :ref:`Chapter 13 of [KÃ¶nig 1990] <>`
for a proof. There is also ga generalization to :math:`n`-oriented graphs, which are covering
spaces of the wedge sum of :math:`n` circles.

|indent| A simply-connected covering space of :math:`X=S^1 \vee S^1` can be constructed in the 
following way. Start with the open intervals :math:`(-1,1)` in 
the coordinate axes of :math:`\mathbb{R}^2`.

Next, for a fixed number :math:`\lambda,\, 0<\lambda \frac{1}{2}`, for example :math:`\lambda = \frac{1}{3}`, adjoin foru open
segments of length :math:`2\lambda`, at distance :math:`\lambda` from the ends of 
the previous segments and perpendicular to them, the
new shorter segments being bisected by the older ones.
For the third stage, add perpendicular open segments of
length :math:`2\lambda^2` at distance :math:`\lambda ^2` from the endpoints of all the 
previous segments and bisected by them. The process
is now repeated indefinitely, aht the :math:`n^{th}` stage adding open segments of length :math:`2\lambda^{n-1}` at 
distance :math:`\lambda^{n-1}` from all the previous endpoints. The union of all these open segments 
is a graph, with vertices the intersection points of horizontal and vertical segments,
and edges the subsegments between adjacent vertices. We label all the horizontal
edges :math:`a`, oriented to the right, and all the vertical edges :math:`b`, oriented upward.

|indent| This covering space is called the *universal cover* of :math:`X` because, as our general
theory will show, it is a covering space of every other connected covering space of :math:`X`.

|indent| The covering spaces (1)-(14) in the talbe are all nonsimply-connected. Their fundamental 
groups are free with bases represented by the loops specified by the listed 
words in :math:`a` and :math:`b`, starting at the basepoint :math:`\tilde{X}_0` indicated by the heavily shaded vertex.
This can be proved in each case by applying :ref:`van Kampen's theorem <Theorem 1.20>`. One can 
also interpret the list of words as generators of the image subgroup :math:`p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0))`
in :math:`\pi_1(X,x_0)=\langle a,b \rangle`. A general fact we shall prove about covering spaces is that
the induced map :math:`p_*:\pi_1(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_0) \rightarrow \pi_1(X,x_0)` is always injective. Thus we have the 
at-first-glance paradoxical fact that the free group on two generators can contain as a 
subgroup a free group on any finite number of generators, or even on a countably 
infinite set of generators as in examples (10) and (11).

|indent| Changing the basepoint vertex changes the subgroup :math:`p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_0))` to a conjugate
subgroup in :math:`\pi_1(X,x_0)`. The conjugating element of :math:`\pi_1(X,x_0)` is represented by 
any loop that is the projection of a path in :math:`\tilde{X}` joining one basepoint to the other. For
example, the covering spaces (3) and (4) differ only in the choice of basepoints, and
the corresponding subgroups of :math:`\pi_1(X,x_0)` differ by conjugation by :math:`b`.

|indent| The main classification theorem for covering spaces says that by associating the 
subgroup :math:`p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_0))` to the covering space :math:`p: \tilde{X} \rightarrow X`, we obtain a one-to-one
correspondence between all the different connected covering spaces of :math:`X` and the 
conjugacy classes of subgroups of :math:`\pi_1(X,x_0)`. If one keeps tract of the basepoint
vertex :math:`\tilde{x}_0 \in \tilde{X}`, then this is one-to-one correspondence between covering spaces
:math:`p:(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0) \rightarrow (X, x_0)` and actual subgroups of :math:`\pi_1(X, x_0)`, not just conjuugacy classes.
Of course, for these statements to make sense one has to have a precise notion of 
when two covering spaces are the  same, or 'isomorphic'. In the case at hand, an isomorphism
between covering spaces of :math:`X` is just a graph isomorphism that preserves 
the labeling and orientations of edges. Thus the covering spaces in (3) and (4) are
isomorphic, but not by an isomorphism preserving basepoints, so the two subgroups
of :math:`\pi_1(X,x_0)` corresponding to these covering spaces are distinct but conjugate. On
the other hand, the two covering spaces in (5) and (6) are not isomorphic, though the 
graphs are homeomorphic, so the corresponding subgroups of :math:`\pi_1(X, x_0)` are isomorphic 
but not conjugate.

|indent| Some of the covering spaces (1)-(14) are more symmetric than others, where by
a 'symmetry' we mean a automorphism of the graph preserving the labeling and 
orientations. The most symmetric covering spaces are those having symmetries taking
any one vertex onto any other. The examples (1), (2), (5)-(8), and (11) are the ones with
this property. We shall see that a covering space of :math:`X` has maximal symmetry exactly
when the corresponding subgroup of :math:`\pi_1(X,x_0)` is a normal subgroup, and in this case
the symmetries form a group isomorphic to the quotient group of :math:`\pi_1(X,x_0)` by the 
normal subgroup. Since every group generated by two elements is a quotient group
of :math:`\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}`, this implies that every two-generator group is the symmetry group of some
covering space of :math:`X`.
