Chapter 0. Some Underlying Geometric Notations
===============================================

The aim of this short preliminary chatper is to introduce a few of the most common geometric concepts and constructions in algebraic topology.
The exposition is somewhat informal, with no theorems or proofs until the last couple pages, 
and it should be read in this informal spirit, skipping bits here and there. In fact, this whole chapter could be skipped now, 
to be referred back to later for basic definitions.

*To avoid overusing the word 'continuous' we adopt the convention that maps between spaces are always assumed to be continuous unless otherwise stated.*
