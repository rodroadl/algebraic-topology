    **1.** Construct an explicit deformation retraction of the torus with one point deleted 
    onto a graph consisting of two circles intersecting in a point, namely, longitude and 
    meridian circles of the torus.

    .. _ex2:
    
    **2.** Construct an explicit deformation retraction of :math:`\mathbb{R}^n-\{0\}` onto :math:`S^{n-1}`.

    .. _ex3:

    **3.** (a) Show that the composition of homotopy equivalences :math:`X \rightarrow Y` and :math:`Y\rightarrow Z` is a 
    homotopy equivalence :math:`X\rightarrow Z`. Deduce that homotopy equivalence is an equivalence relation.

    (b) Show that the relation of homotopy among maps :math:`X \rightarrow Y` is an equivalence relation.

    (c) Show that a map homotopic to a homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence.
