Cell complexes

A familiar way of constructing the torus :math:`S^1 \times S^1` is by identifying opposite isdes 
of a square. More generally, an orientable surface :math:`M_g` of  genus :math:`g` can be constructed 
from a polygon with :math:`4g` sides by identifying pairs of edges, as shown in the figure in the first three cases :math:`g=1,2,3`.
